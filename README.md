# Flight-Booker
Flight-Booker is a miniature project for Rails practice.

The purpose of the project is to work on my complex form knowledge, and to reinforce all previous learning.

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rails track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms?ref=lnav)!
